            "abstract": "India, with population steadily increasing by 13-million persons a yr, is reducing birth-control programs across nation; Govt decision, part of stringent econ campaign, means that plans to build family-planning and maternal-care centers in rural areas have been set aside; Govt at same time is sharply reducing mass vasectomy efforts as well as birth-control publicity; India's soaring birth rate has been unchecked by family-planning drives in recent yrs; there are 57,000 Indian babies born daily, or 21-million a yr; about 8-million Indians die each yr; India's population, about 570-million, is expected to reach 1-billion by end of century; Govt's target was to reduce birth rate from 41 per thousand population in '68 to 25 per thousand by '76; has now extended target date until '80; birth rate is now about 37 per thousand; budget slash was made known when provisions for '73-74 were approved recently; Health and Planning Min had asked for $81.1-million, considerably lower than previous yr's budget of $104-million; Govt cut allocation to $75.1-million; more discouraging to family-planning workers are repts that Govt is about to cut back birth-control programs further; Health Min sr officials are reluctant to discuss slash in family-planning budget, partly because decision was made at top levels of Govt; Govt officials have stated publicly that stringent econ measures are necessary in 'welfare' ministries dealing with 'nonessentials' such as health and family planning; key reasons for cutback are unplanned expenditures for drought relief, wage increase among Govt employes and inflation; A C Sekhar, one of India's highest family-planning officials, denies that budget cuts will seriously curtail birth-control programs; indicates that cuts will 'drastically limit additional monetary incentives' for vasectomy operations; 13-million Indians have been sterilized since '66; effort to control birth rate has lagged because of illiteracy among most of 80% of India's population that live in rural areas, traditions whereby large families are feared and respected in villages, and psychological inhibitions about accepting family-planning measures; Hindus are being told by their militant colleagues that since Moslems and Catholics are not restricting their families, majority of Hindus should also shun birth control or they will lose their numerical strength; authorities say that over 13% of 100-million couples of reproductive age, where wife is between 15 and 44, are using birth-control devices; most devices have met some form of hostility; about 4.5-million women have been fitted with interuterine device; smaller number of men and women use contraceptives such as condom, which has been resisted because it is linked with prostitutes and extra marital relations; birth-contol pills are not popular in India",

They canceled. They'll never cancel another time'; White House deputy press sec Warren says on Aug 21 that Nixon was alluding to another matter that Woods was working on with Pres and not to motorcade; Secret Service agents and score of heavily armed state and local officers search near Taos, NM, on Aug 21 for E M Gaudet, ex\u2010New Orleans policeman who has been charged with making separate threat against Nixon's life; J P Jones, chief of NM Secret Service says on Aug 21 that local officers exchanged gunfire on Aug 20 with man they believed to be Gaudet, who disappeared into nearby arroyo after firing 2 shots from high\u2010powered rifle; arrest warrant issued Aug 20 alleges that Gaudet said in a New Orleans bar last wk, 'Somebody ought to kill Pres Nixon. If no one has the guts, I'll do it'; Secret Service officials say they have found no evidence to connect Gaudet to reptd assassination conspiracy, but will not preclude possibility that connection might turn up; officials of FBI and Secret Service insist that alleged conspiracy is both broad and intensely serious and that its threat had not been 'blown out of proportion'; New Orleans police officials say they are unable to explain why change in route of Nixon's motorcade was publicly disclosed in advance of Nixon's arrival, a move that presumably would have alerted any conspirators that their plot had been uncovered and providing them time to flee; police officials say decision to make announcment was that of Secret Service, which said on Aug 20 that move was response to expected inquiries from reporters about change in Pres's plans",
