Artful Kurosawa.", "lead_paragraph": "Japan's leading film producing concern, the Toho Company, which has acquired the former Bijou Theater on 45th Street as a New York showcase for Japanese films, opened that film teahouse last evening as the Toho Cinema with Tkira Kurosawa's new picture entitled in English \"The Bad Sleep Well.\"If all the future imports in this theater are as forceful and engrossing as this one from the director of a long list of Japanese champions, beginning with \"Rashomon\", local film fans are due for a lot of excitement and the popularity of the project should be assured.\"The Bad Sleep Well\" is an aggressive and chilling drama of modern-day Japan, exposing a fringe of \"big business\" in the forthright manner of an American gangster film. While the conflicts of its intense antagonists\u2014corporate executives all\u2014are in the realm of legal proceedings, they are rooted in corruption and greed, and the devices by which the rivals fight each other are the devices of racketeers.At the opening, when a rising young executive, played soberly by Toshiro Mifune, star of many Kurosawa pictures, is being elaborately wed to the daughter of a big business magnate, the ceremony has the look and air of one of the gangland social gatherings we used to see in the Cagney and Robinson films. The ostentation of wealth among the tycoons is vulgar and rash to a gross degree.At the wedding feast tension begins to develop through a ghostly reminder of an old corporation scandal and the lines are laid down for the projection of melodramatic events that follow precisely the pattern of bribery, kidnaping and killing in a gangster film.It is to Kurosawa's credit that he has staged what amounts to cliches in this type of strongarm fiction in a way that makes them seem fresh and as fully of sardonic humor as though we had never seen their likes before. And it is further to his credit that he gives to an ordinary tale of greedy and murderous contention a certain basic philosophical tone.His bitter and cynical recounting of the failure of a right-thinking young man \u2014 the fellow played by Mifune \u2014 to expose and thus get revenge on a group of old corporation robbers might almost be taken as a reflection of modern cynicism toward the old war lords in Japan.This is a powerful and interesting picture that Kurosawa has made\u2014a bit tedious and mawkish in the last reels, but exciting enough along the way to satisfy audiences that know the subject.

That is evident in \"40 Pounds of Trouble,\" which opened yesterday at the Palace and other metropolitan theaters.Although no credit is given to Mr. Runyon's sentimental conceit, in which, you will remember, Shirley Temple made her screen debut, it is clearly the inspiration for the slapdash and witless script that Marion Hargrove has knocked together for this bluntly promotional film.It has Tony Curtis acting as a jazzy manager of a Nevada gambling club who suddenly finds himself the custodian of a left-over female child at the same time that he is wooing the snappy girl singer at the club. This, of course, is the situation in which Little Miss Marker's guardian was.But, unhappily, Mr. Hargrove's treasury of whimsey and wit is very thin, providing nothing more than labored humor for the goons who have to help amuse the child. And his weak and probably fore-ordained solution for the dilemma is a visit with the child to Disneyland, which is photographed and plugged from every angle \u2014 including the angle of salesmanship.Considering that the first part of the picture is pretty much an illustrated plug for Harrah's Club at Lake Tahoe, Nev., where much of it was brightly photographed, one might reckon it a television picture, with obvious commercials built in. And considering that its first-time-out director, Norman Jewison, is straight from television, it's no wonder that it has a video look.Mr. Curtis, Suzanne Pleshette as the singer and Claire Wilcox as the baby-talking child are as banal as spot-commercial hawkers of headache tablets or crunchy breakfast foods.The trouble with \"40 Pounds of Trouble\" is that it is just too hackneyed and dull.", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Screen: '40 Pounds of Trouble':Film Is Witless Remake of a Runyon Story Blunt Promotion, Thin Humor Fill Script 'Sodom and Gomorrah'", "kicker": null, "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "Screen: '40 Pounds of Trouble':Film Is Witless Remake of a Runyon Story Blunt Promotion, Thin Humor Fill Script 'Sodom and Gomorrah'", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "MOTION PICTURES", "rank": 1, "major": "N"}, {"name": "creative_works", "value": "Sodom and Gomorrah (Movie)", "rank": 2, "major": "N"}, {"name": "creative_works", "value": "40 Pounds of Trouble (Movie)", "rank": 3, "major": "N"}], "pub_date": "1963-01-24T05:00:00+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "", "section_name": "Archives", "byline": {"original": "By Bosley Crowther Special To the New York Times", "person": [{"firstname": "Bosley", "middlename": "Crowther", "lastname": "Special", "qualifier": null, "title": null, "role": "reported", "organization": "", "rank": 1}], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "Review", "_id": "nyt://article/e3b70b6d-507c-5c93-af3c-bdfcc48f5551", "word_count": 724, "uri": "nyt://article/e3b70b6d-507c-5c93-af3c-bdfcc48f5551"}, {"abstract": "", "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1963/01/24/archives/veterans-dividends-speeded.html", "snippet": "", "lead_paragraph": "", "print_page": "4", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Veterans' Dividends Speeded", "kicker": "1", "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "Veterans' Dividends Speeded", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [], "pub_date": "1963-01-24T05:00:00+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "None", "section_name": "Archives", "byline": {"original": "", "person": [], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "Archives", "_id": "nyt://article/e4a10a95-aaae-5b6d-bb18-2bd8f3835a1a", "word_count": 0, "uri": "nyt://article/e4a10a95-aaae-5b6d-bb18-2bd8f3835a1a"}, {"abstract": "Rear Adm Mackenzie takes command of Polaris program; illus", "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1963/01/24/archives/article-1-no-title.html", "snippet": "Rear Adm Mackenzie takes command of Polaris program; illus", "lead_paragraph": "", "print_page": "2", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Article 1 -- No Title", "kicker": null, "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "Article 1 -- No Title", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [{"name": "glocations", "value": "Great Britain", "rank": 1, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ARMAMENT, DEFENSE AND MILITARY FORCES", "rank": 2, "major": "N"}], "pub_date": "1963-01-24T05:00:00+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "None", "section_name": "Archives", "byline": {"original": "", "person": [], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "Archives", "_id": "nyt://article/e4b01457-a119-553d-9a0e-95efef1cf8e7", "word_count": 0, "uri": "nyt://article/e4b01457-a119-553d-9a0e-95efef1cf8e7"}, {"abstract": "thousands of Katangese soldiers slip into bush with weapons as UN begins task of disarming them; Tshombe repts attack by mercenaries, gets armed guard; mercenaries illus", "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1963/01/24/archives/tension-remains-as-un-begins-disarming-katangas-soldiers.html", "snippet": "thousands of Katangese soldiers slip into bush with weapons as UN begins task of disarming them; Tshombe repts attack by mercenaries, gets armed guard; mercenaries illus", "lead_paragraph": "", "print_page": "3", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Tension Remains as U.N.

And that's why \"Term of Trial,\" which came to the Paramount yesterday, is not an exciting picture, for all its skittering around a sordid theme.The meek and shabby high school teacher that Mr. Olivier plays in this British rehash of \"Blackboard Jungle,\" with minor \"Lolita\" overtones, is a wistful and well-meaning fellow for whom your heart bleeds a drop or two as you watch him stoically enduring all sorts of troubles and woes. But he's just not enough of a person to make your blood run hot or cold.Sure, that wife of his, that tawdry creature who is played by Simone Signoret with a sharp edge of lofty cynicism and cutting asperity \u2014 she's enough to drive any poor fellow to drink, which, indeed, she does. When things get too tough for our poor fellow, he sneaks into a nearby pub and tipples a bit to calm his jitters and soothe the hurt of his idealistic soul.And that miserable brute of a pupil\u2014that impudent, vicious high school boy\u2014he's a thorn to harass any teacher, no matter how rugged he may be. To Mr. Olivier's milk-sop, he's a constant and terrifying chore.And even the pompous headmaster, played by Frank Pettingell, is a cruel and discouraging deflator of a sensitive teacher's pride.So you would hope our fellow might be fired upon when a pretty blond pupil pops along and sets her cap ardently for him. You would think he might discreetly nod. But not at all\u2014not even when this nimble and precocious 16-year-old, played with extraordinary fervor by a new British girl, Sarah Miles, throws herself candidly at him while in Paris on a student tour\u2014does he so much as loosen his hairshirt. No, he's bent on suffering and he does.That is the weakness of this picture, which Peter Glenville has derived from a novel by James Barlow and has directed in the current British \"kitchen sink\" style. It tediously pushes the hero into a hollow and melancholy mold that seems contrived to display a bleak example of ironic injustice, nothing more. And no matter how patiently and deftly Mr. Olivier plays the role, with all of his skill at portraying discomfort and down-at-heel wistfulness, he cannot quite make this fellow absorbing \u2014 or even wholly real.And, we must say, the cheap fiction snapper that Mr. Glenville has put on the end\u2014the twist by which the hounded hero regains the respect of his wife\u2014is completely out of keeping with the rest of this down-beat account. It's as though they hoped to save it with a wry joke\u2014a sort of Rabelaisian ending.
