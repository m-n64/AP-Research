In another, he is a Bolognese merchant helping a shifty confederate defraud an unreasonably gullible victim in a thoroughly impossible deal. In yet another, he is a Japanese bridegroom and, again, a game-legged, iron-jawed general.Farce is the basic exposition in this virtually one-man show. It hasn't the character variations of, say, \"Big Deal on Madonna Street.\" But it does have much of the same dryness and gusto of that Roman comedy, in which, incidentally, Mr. Gassman first demonstrated his comic skill.As his impish companion in this one. Peppino de Filippo makes one feel a great homesickness for those rubberized comedians that used to show up in American vaudeville. Dorian Gray is agile and attractive as his female confederate in a couple of deals, and little Anna Maria Ferrero is charming as the girl who hooks him.

It is a wistful little contemplation of a minor frustration of love.The second tells of the torment of a pretty Roman girl who loses her poor young lover to an older and wealthy woman. And the third is a morbid observation of the frenzy of a young worker in Japan who cannot summon the courage to speak to a girl he has admired.Renzo Rossellini, son of Roberto, directed the Italian bit, which has no particular distinction. However, the Japanese anecdote, directed by Shintaro Ishihara, has a weird, grotesque quality. It makes one wonder whether it fairly reflects the state of young love in Japan.Likewise, a German episode, directed by Marcel Ophuls, son of Max, gives a rather dubious notion of love in Germany. It tells how an unwed mother finally hooks the casual father of her child. It is charming, but somewhat sentimental for the bitter story it tells.The last of the lot, directed by Andrzej Wajda of Poland, is best, being both wistful and reflective of the current temper of youth. A girl is impressed by an act of bravery that an older man performs and takes him home to her apartment. She later shows him the door when he acts in a curious fashion. She thinks he is clumsy or drunk but he is actually remembering a bad experience he had in World War II.These episodes, held together by a series of still photographs of young lovers by Henri Cartier-Bresson, are interesting as youthful exercises, even though they do not tell us much about the \"grand passion\" that we don't already know.English subtitles translate the various languages used in the episode, and a wistful jazz musical theme runs through the whole.", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Screen: 5 Tales of Young Love:Suffering Is Depicted in Foreign Episodes", "kicker": null, "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "Screen: 5 Tales of Young Love:Suffering Is Depicted in Foreign Episodes", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "MOTION PICTURES", "rank": 1, "major": "N"}, {"name": "creative_works", "value": "Love at Twenty (Movie)", "rank": 2, "major": "N"}], "pub_date": "1963-02-07T05:00:00+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "", "section_name": "Archives", "byline": {"original": "By Bosley Crowther Special To the New York Times", "person": [{"firstname": "Bosley", "middlename": "Crowther", "lastname": "Special", "qualifier": null, "title": null, "role": "reported", "organization": "", "rank": 1}], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "Review", "_id": "nyt://article/e38b3044-8214-5d86-a104-603a40aa80f6", "word_count": 563, "uri": "nyt://article/e38b3044-8214-5d86-a104-603a40aa80f6"}, {"abstract": "Amer Motors repts Ramblers led US cars in exports, '62; gets US 'E for Export' award", "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1963/02/07/archives/american-motors-head-denies-compactcar-market-shrinks-standard.html", "snippet": "Amer Motors repts Ramblers led US cars in exports, '62; gets US 'E for Export' award", "lead_paragraph": "", "print_section": "Business & Finance", "print_page": "10", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "American Motors Head Denies Compact-Car Market Shrinks; Standard Sales Passed American Motors Head Denies Compact-Car Market Shrinks", "kicker": null, "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "American Motors Head Denies Compact-Car Market Shrinks; Standard Sales Passed American Motors Head Denies Compact-Car Market Shrinks", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [{"name": "glocations", "value": "United States", "rank": 1, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Automobiles", "rank": 2, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "GENERAL", "rank": 3, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Automobiles", "rank": 4, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "EXPORTS AND IMPORTS", "rank": 5, "major": "N"}], "pub_date": "1963-02-07T05:00:00+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "None", "section_name": "Archives", "byline": {"original": "Special to The New York Times", "person": [{"firstname": "", "middlename": null, "lastname": "", "qualifier": null, "title": null, "role": "reported", "organization": "", "rank": 1}], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "Archives", "_id": "nyt://article/e47939b1-70af-5ac8-8f04-4b31432574e7", "word_count": 0, "uri": "nyt://article/e47939b1-70af-5ac8-8f04-4b31432574e7"}, {"abstract": "NEW YORK.

The drama of social service, written by Abby Mann to convey a general illustration of the philosophy and kind of work done in modern institutions for retarded children, is presented in such conventional terms that it has no more impact or validity than an average television-doctor show.It is simply the story of a young woman, whom Judy Garland plays with a good deal of soulful agonizing, who gets herself a job in a home for defective or backward children and is almost carried away by pity for one little fellow whose parents have apparently forgotten him.But when she precipitates a crisis that upsets everyone, including the child, by appealing to the parents, who are themselves emotionally disturbed, she comes to understand the philosophy of the head doctor, Burt Lancaster. It is that retarded children cannot be pampered; they must be taught to have self-reliance, be one of their group and fend for themselves.Miss Garland's misty-eyed compassion and Mr. Lancaster's crisp authority as the all-seeing, all-knowing doctor who patiently runs the home are of a standard dramatic order. Gena Rowlands and Steven Hill are a bit more erratic and thus convincing as the highly emotional parents of the boy. But top honors go to Bruce Ritchey, who plays the latter role, and to the group of actual retarded children who appear uninhibitedly in this film.To them and to John Cassavetes, who directed them with notable control \u2014 and perhaps to these children's real-life teachers, who must have helped him from close by behind the scenes \u2014 we must be thankful that what might have been harrowing and even distasteful beyond words to behold comes out as a forthright, moving documentation of most unfortunate but hopeful youngsters in a school.From the graphic accounts of how their teachers treat them and train them, how the rule of firm, realistic and unemotional discipline is preserved, and from the simplifications of theory that appear in the dialogue, one should learn a great deal from this picture\u2014all of which should be helpful and give hope.", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "The Screen: 'A Child Is Waiting':Social Drama Is Painful but Compelling Films Tells the Story of Retarded Youngsters", "kicker": null, "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "The Screen: 'A Child Is Waiting':Social Drama Is Painful but Compelling Films Tells the Story of Retarded Youngsters", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "MOTION PICTURES", "rank": 1, "major": "N"}, {"name": "creative_works", "value": "Child Is Waiting, A (Movie)", "rank": 2, "major": "N"}], "pub_date": "1963-02-14T05:00:00+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "", "section_name": "Archives", "byline": {"original": "By Bosley Crowther Special To the New York Times", "person": [{"firstname": "Bosley", "middlename": "Crowther", "lastname": "Special", "qualifier": null, "title": null, "role": "reported", "organization": "", "rank": 1}], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "Review", "_id": "nyt://article/b3375569-d743-5289-adce-cc9fa7965f0b", "word_count": 532, "uri": "nyt://article/b3375569-d743-5289-adce-cc9fa7965f0b"}, {"abstract": "'deal' to extend US occupation of naval installations at Kenitra reptd pending", "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1963/02/14/archives/usmorocco-deal-on-bases-reported.html", "snippet": "'deal' to extend US occupation of naval installations at Kenitra reptd pending", "lead_paragraph": "", "print_page": "2", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "U.S.-MOROCCO DEAL ON BASES REPORTED", "kicker": null, "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "U.S.-MOROCCO DEAL ON BASES REPORTED", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [{"name": "glocations", "value": "Morocco", "rank": 1, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "US BASES AND FORCES", "rank": 2, "major": "N"}], "pub_date": "1963-02-14T05:00:00+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "None", "section_name": "Archives", "byline": {"original": "Special to The New York Times", "person": [{"firstname": "", "middlename": null, "lastname": "", "qualifier": null, "title": null, "role": "reported", "organization": "", "rank": 1}], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "Archives", "_id": "nyt://article/b51cc3f2-625f-5656-af31-8566a10f1e84", "word_count": 0, "uri": "nyt://article/b51cc3f2-625f-5656-af31-8566a10f1e84"}, {"abstract": "Powers and ITU Mailers pres Laura en route to Colo to rept to ITU exec council;

Superb, moving adaptation of Harper Lee novel.", "lead_paragraph": "There is so much feeling for children in the film that has been made from Harper Lees best-selling novel, \"To Kill a Mockingbird'. . . so much delightful observation of their spirit, energy and charm as depicted by two superb discoveries, Mary Badham and Phillip Alford\u2014that it comes as a bit of a letdown at the end to realize that, for all the picture's feeling for children, it doesn't tell us very much of how they feel.This is the one adult omission that is regretful in this fine film that Alan J. Pakula and Universal delivered to the Music Hall yesterday.At the outset, it plops us down serenely in the comfort of a grubby Southern town at the time of the Great Depression, before \"desegregation\" was even a word. Here we are brought into contact with Scott Finch, a 6-year old girl who is a thoroughly beguiling tomboy; her 10-year old brother, Jem, and their widowered father, Atticus, who is clearly the kindest man in town.And for a fair spell it looks as though maybe we are going to be squeezed inside the skin of Scott and Jem as they go racing and tumbling around the neighborhood, shrieking with childish defiance at crusty old Mrs. Dubose, skirting with awe around the dark house where the mysterous Boo Radley lives.So long as the film is on this level, the director, Robert Mulligan, achieves a bewitching indication of the excitement and thrill of being a child.It is when the drama develops along the conventional line of a social crisis in the community\u2014the charging of a Negro with the rape of a white woman\u2014that the children are switched to the roles of lookers-on. They become but observers in the gallery as their father, played superbly by Gregory Peck, goes through a lengthy melodrama of defending the Negro in Court and giving a strong but adult lesson of justice and humanity at work.And their roles are still those of bystanders in a subsequent episode when they are attacked by a vengeful Negro-baiter and brought to realize that the strange Boo Radley is not a monster but a friend.It is, in short, on the level of adult awareness of right and wrong, of good and evil, that most of the action in the picture occurs. And this detracts from the camera's observation of the point of view of the child.While this still permits vivid melodrama and some touching observations of the children, especially in their relations with their father, which is the crucial relationship in the film, it leaves the viewer wondering precisely how the children feel. How have they really reacted to the things that affect our grown-up minds?Horton Foote's script and the direction of Mr. Mulligan may not penetrate that deeply, but they do allow Mr. Peck and little Miss Badham and Master Alford to portray delightful characters. Their charming enactments of a father and his children in that close relationship that can occur at only one brief period are worth all the footage of the film.Rosemary Murphy as a neighbor, Brock Peters as the Negro on trial and Frank Overton as a troubled sheriff are good as locality characters, too. James Anderson and Collin Wilcox as Southern bigots are almost caricatures. But those are minor shortcomings in a rewarding film.", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Screen: 'To Kill a Mockingbird':One Adult Omission in a Fine Film 2 Superb Discoveries Add to Delight", "kicker": null, "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "Screen: 'To Kill a Mockingbird':One Adult Omission in a Fine Film 2 Superb Discoveries Add to Delight", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "MOTION PICTURES", "rank": 1, "major": "N"}, {"name": "creative_works", "value": "To Kill a Mockingbird (Movie)", "rank": 2, "major": "N"}], "pub_date": "1963-02-15T05:00:00+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "", "section_name": "Archives", "byline": {"original": "By Bosley Crowther Special To the New York Times", "person": [{"firstname": "Bosley", "middlename": "Crowther", "lastname": "Special", "qualifier": null, "title": null, "role": "reported", "organization": "", "rank": 1}], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "Review", "_id": "nyt://article/3917da8f-9627-5f62-8dfd-80634b890660", "word_count": 606, "uri": "nyt://article/3917da8f-9627-5f62-8dfd-80634b890660"}, {"abstract": "Africans seek to leave;

And it is made to seem even more distasteful and avoidable in this case by the fact that the order is of dubious validity and the Korean prisoner could be got rid of in some other way than by shooting him.No wonder, then, that one young private, whom Robert Walker plays, refuses point blank to do the shooting when Mr. Douglas passes the order to him, and another, played by Nick Adams, evades the assignment by getting drunk. Needless to say, the viewer is inclined to be in complete and impatient agreement with these lads.So now the question is whether the sergeant can bring himself to do the deed. Well, he can't, of course. It's no crime for sergeants. And that's the total drama of the film, except for an ironic ending that permits a bit of cliff-hanging suspense.It is such an obviously slanted issue that it is really no issue at all.

But when he finds that they fail him or prove too risky for all their good, he lays out his flight maneuvers more or less on his own.Some of his attempts are very funny, some are reckless, some are sad and some have sobering traces of grimness and irony. Within them, there grows the implication that imprisonment is something like life and that the inevitable wish of the brave man, however humble, is to escape.The skill with which Renoir has tangled the comical and the grave, following an episode of nonsense with a sprinkle of minor agony (such as the punishment of grueling exercises meted out to the little hero after each unsuccessful attempt at escape), accounts for the rising of this picture above the level of P.O.W. farce. And the trace of philosophical implication makes it worth more than lightly passing through.The corporal is played with sad-eyed brightness by Jean-Pierre Cassel, the impish fellow who did \"The Joker\" and \"Five-Day Lover\" with such elan. He gives to the role a melancholy that is suitable to the clown. His air is that of a gate-crasher, ever hopeful, who invariably gets caught.Claude Brasseur, as an older companion who finally keeps up with him on his ultimate escape to Paris and to the dank, depressing odors of the Seine, is rough and ready as a French type. And others are amusingly played by Claude Rich, Mario David, Jacques Jouanneau and Jean Carmet. Conny Forboess is charming as a German girl who lends a hand.Intercut shots from actual war films attempt to suggest the idea that this is an authentic war drama, but that shouldn't fool anyone.", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Screen: An Elusive French P.O.W.:Renoir Examines Man's Drive to Escape", "kicker": null, "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "Screen: An Elusive French P.O.W.:Renoir Examines Man's Drive to Escape", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "MOTION PICTURES", "rank": 1, "major": "N"}, {"name": "creative_works", "value": "Elusive Corporal, The (Movie)", "rank": 2, "major": "N"}], "pub_date": "1963-02-19T05:00:00+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "", "section_name": "Archives", "byline": {"original": "By Bosley Crowther Special To the New York Times", "person": [{"firstname": "Bosley", "middlename": "Crowther", "lastname": "Special", "qualifier": null, "title": null, "role": "reported", "organization": "", "rank": 1}], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "Review", "_id": "nyt://article/0d566f9f-d7c8-582a-b459-d4e5dd8d192c", "word_count": 595, "uri": "nyt://article/0d566f9f-d7c8-582a-b459-d4e5dd8d192c"}, {"abstract": "Queen illus with Prime Min Menzies, Canberra", "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1963/02/19/archives/article-1-no-title.html", "snippet": "Queen illus with Prime Min Menzies, Canberra", "lead_paragraph": "", "print_page": "2", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Article 1 -- No Title", "kicker": null, "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "Article 1 -- No Title", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "MENZIES, ROBERT GORDON", "rank": 1, "major": "N"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "ELIZABETH II, QUEEN OF THE UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND AND OF HER OTHER REALMS AND TERRITORIES AND HEAD OF THE COMMONWEALTH", "rank": 2, "major": "N"}], "pub_date": "1963-02-19T05:00:00+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "None", "section_name": "Archives", "byline": {"original": "", "person": [], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "Archives", "_id": "nyt://article/1009ef4d-a60d-54d7-82fd-5195d50f799c", "word_count": 0, "uri": "nyt://article/1009ef4d-a60d-54d7-82fd-5195d50f799c"}, {"abstract": "", "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1963/02/19/archives/5-fives-accept-bids-to-ncaa-tourney.html", "snippet": "", "lead_paragraph": "", "print_section": "S", "print_page": "16", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "5 FIVES ACCEPT BIDS TO N.C.A.A.

Well done but grim, grim, grim.", "lead_paragraph": "The morbid interest of Irish writers in prison, hangman and death, as manifested in plays of Sean O'Casey and Lady Gregory, emerges again in the grim film that Arthur Dreifuss has made of Brendan Behan's sad play, \"The Quare Fellow,\" which opened at the Carnegie Hall Cinema yesterday.Horror and hatred of penal servitude and especially of the practice of punishing criminals by death constitute the total tenor and atmosphere of this film, which has a harsh Irish eloquence about it and a certain brutal dramatic punch.From the moment the film enters a Dublin prison it coldly erodes any notion that prisons are human and that hanging is justifiable by any mortal or social need.The melancholy song of an unseen singer that comes up from the ominous well in the courtyard of the great stone prison, the skeptical look on the face of an older guard when a young one prattles his disciplinary zeal, the anger and tension among the inmates as time grows shorter before the execution date of a condemned man\u2014the mythical \"Quare Fellow\"\u2014these all transmit a sensitive mood.But the drama congeals when the young guard, whom Patrick McGoohan plays with a nice show of boyish brusqueness, learns from the condemned man's frantic wife why he committed murder and why it is injustice to hang him.Then horror and indignation gain momentum as the young guard tries to beg a reprieve, the wife seeks review of the conviction, the prison authorities refuse to be moved and the dismal execution of the \"Quare Fellow\" is carried out as ordained.It is a distressing culmination, made so by the strong emotional pull that Mr. Behan has written into his drama and Mr. Dreifuss has created on the screen, more than by any concrete evidence that the punishment is unjustified.That emotional pull is developed mainly in the performance of Sylvia Sims, who plays the wife with a fine rush of passion that almost reaches hysteria. Walter Macken is also impassioned in a firm, controlled way as the older guard and Mr. McGoohan assists in its promotion with his fervid, forceful approach.Jack Cunningham as the prison warden, Hilton Edwards, as an interested prisoner and Arthur O'Sullivan as the hangman who is brought in \"to top the Quare Fellow\" are fine. Especially Mr. O'Sullivan, in a ribald and grisly episode toward the end, when he has lost the box containing his \"tools\" in a pub, gives a lot to the one touch of humor and anomalous satire in the film.", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Screen: 'The Quare Fellow':Behan Film Is Grim but Harshly Eloquent", "kicker": null, "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "Screen: 'The Quare Fellow':Behan Film Is Grim but Harshly Eloquent", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "MOTION PICTURES", "rank": 1, "major": "N"}, {"name": "creative_works", "value": "Quare Fellow (Movie)", "rank": 2, "major": "N"}], "pub_date": "1963-02-20T05:00:00+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "", "section_name": "Archives", "byline": {"original": "By Bosley Crowther Special To the New York Times.

Heavy, murky but boldly original, often gripping.", "lead_paragraph": "Whatever Franz Kafka was laboriously attempting to say about the tyranny of modern social systems in his novel, \"The Trial\" is still thoroughly fuzzy and hard to fathom in the film Orson Welles has finally made from the 40-year-old novel. \"The Trial\" opened at the Guild and the new R.K.O. 23d Street Theatre yesterday.Evidently it is something quite horrisic about the brutal, relentless way in which the law as a social institution reaches out and enmeshes men in its complex and calculating clutches until it crushes them to death.At least, that is what this viewer gathers from the crazy and symbolistic stuff that Mr. Welles and an excellent cast of actors have regurgitated on the screen. That is what seems to be the message, in this wild and wooly account of the serialistic experiences of a baffled, rebellious young man after he has been mysteriously arrested by secret agents and prepared for some sort of formal trial.But don't expect us to analyze it or clarify what Mr. Welles has rendered pictorial out of Kafka, any more than he has done so himself despite some impressive staging and some startling pictorial effects, achieved by shooting much of the picture in the old abandoned Paris railway station, the Gard d'Orsay, he has not reduced the weird proceedings to a clear dramatic line or arrived at an intellectual conclusion that is readily understood.The strange geometric arrangements of rooms and people at work, of overstressed filing cabinets and the faces and forms of characters, make pungent visual stimulation, but they only bewilder the mind. They do not fall into patterns that convey congealing ideas.Likewise, the offbeat acting has pictorial qualities but it does not bring out consistent or even clear revelations, of character. Anthony Perkins as the baffled hero has a wild and frightened air. He is a credible victim of a mystery. But that's about all he is. Jeanne Moreau is an utter enigma as a girl he meets early in the film and Mr. Welles himself is a monstrous facade of something sinister as a hero's advocate.Akim Tamaroff, Romy Schneider, Elsa Martinelli and Suzanne Flon are other symbolic figures in this confusing film.At best, it is another demonstration of the camera vers atility of Mr. Welles; at worse, a further Kafka demonstration extending to the demanding medium of the screen.", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "Screen: 'The Trial' Still an Enigma:Welles Compounds the Murkiness of Kafka", "kicker": null, "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "Screen: 'The Trial' Still an Enigma:Welles Compounds the Murkiness of Kafka", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "MOTION PICTURES", "rank": 1, "major": "N"}, {"name": "creative_works", "value": "Trial, The (Movie)", "rank": 2, "major": "N"}], "pub_date": "1963-02-21T05:00:00+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "", "section_name": "Archives", "byline": {"original": "By Bosley Crowther Special To the New York Times.
